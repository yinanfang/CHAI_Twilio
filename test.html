You are allowed to deauthenticate clients associated with this Wi-FI network, but <b>ONLY</b> \nthis network. Do <b>NOT</b> attempt to deauthenticate clients on any other UNC network.\n<br/>The data received from the lock\nis in notifications, you should see the message enabling them. Some of the packets \nare fragmented - if you see a packet just with payload "0a", append it to the previous one.\nThere is some sort of challenge response, and the data seems to be\nencoded. Maybe you could use the encode / decode function from the\nlibrary?\nThe &ltinit&gt messages contains 10 digits. Upon receiving a correct init\nmessage, the lock will issue a new challenge.\nThe challenge response message is tricky: it contains the response\nvalue padded with null bytes up to 10 bytes, followed by two bytes\n0x20 0x32.\nAfter a successful challenge response and a &ltclose&gt message the lock will open.\n\nSo to try this yourself, the easiest thing is to recover the three\nvalues for: &ltinit&gt,&ltinferred key&gt,&ltclose&gt and then you can use your\nnifty application that takes these values as input and opens the lock.\n\n |
